Also linked to Swing Voter’s Curse literature. (Source: page 18, words 275–496)\n\n- Campaign contributions data and identification strategy\n  - Data: campaign contributions to House candidates from Kuziemko et al. 2023 (Oct), built from FEC data via Bonica 2014.\n  - Identification: geocode to flag whether contributor lives in the same congressional district as the candidate. (Source: page 18)\n\n- Border-pairs empirical design and estimation\n  - Design: compare county-pair deviations from their pair mean; restrict to counties fully within one district; collapse to county level to keep within-district border variation.\n  - Key specification: y_ct = α_c + μ_pt + β π̄_c,t + X_ct δ + ε_ct (11); β is the coefficient of interest; include state-by-year fixed effects; no district-by-year fixed effects due to data limits. (Source: page 28, 0–349)\n\n- Conceptual framework: information diffusion within districts\n  - Main idea: district homophily summarizes network structure, shaping the diffusion of information and the equilibrium share of informed voters. (Source: page 39, 0–327)\n\n- Appendix B: data construction and variable descriptions\n  - B.1: construction of vote-count measures (county-by-CD; sources include Harvard MIT data for various years, Dave Leip’s Atlas, Daily Kos)\n  - B.2: variable descriptions for CES and voting outcomes (e.g., Heard of Representative, Selected Party, Voted in General Election, etc.)\n  - B.3–B.5: descriptive statistics for CES outcomes and voting measures (Source: page 47–49)\n\n- Appendix C: data and figures (highlights)\n  - C2: results for border-pairs design; C5, C11, C14 figures illustrating district homophily effects on self-reported voting outcomes (Source: page 64; figure references on 54, 61, 64)\n\nIf you’d like, I can extract specific equations or variable definitions into a compact reference list.

This provides a direct measure of the information diffusion/participation gap within districts. (Source: page 18)\n\n- Empirical strategy to identify diffusion within districts: A border-pairs design that compares county-pair deviations from their pair means, restricting to counties fully within a single district and collapsing to the county level to isolate within-district border variation. The key specification is\n  y_{ct} = α_c + μ_{pt} + β \\bar{π}_{c,t} + X_{ct} δ + ε_{ct},\n  with β the coefficient of interest; estimated with state-by-year fixed effects and no district-by-year fixed effects due to data limits. (Source: page 28)\n\n- Data and identification leveraging donors: Campaign contributions to House candidates (Kuziemko et al. 2023; built from FEC via Bonica 2014) are geocoded to flag whether a contributor lives in the same congressional district as the candidate, enabling analysis of geographic proximity as a channel for information diffusion. (Source: page 18)\n\n- Conceptual mechanism: Information diffusion within districts is shaped by district homophily, which summarizes network structure and governs the diffusion process and the equilibrium share of informed voters. (Source: page 39)\n\n- Data construction and variables (appendix grounding): Appendix B documents vote-count construction (county-by-CD from multiple data sources) and variable descriptions for CES and voting outcomes (e.g., Heard of Representative, Selected Party, Voted in General Election); Appendix C highlights border-pairs results and district-homophily effects on self-reported voting outcomes (C2; C5, C11, C14).

        "answer": "Results may differ across time periods and markets because the size and timing of changes in district homophily depend on redistricting events, and the observable effects on voter information and choices vary by year and market. After redistricting, changes in district homophily are larger and have the strongest impact on voter knowledge in the first post-redistricting survey (2014), with effects stabilizing over time. Odd-year data are noisier due to smaller samples, reducing precision. In markets, controlling for media-market structure (DMA-by-year fixed effects) can attenuate or eliminate some effects (e.g., the Selected Party outcome in border-pairs designs), indicating variability in results across markets depending on diffusion through media and local networks.",

Key findings suggest that increasing district homophily (alignment of county networks with districts) improves voter knowledge, reduces roll-off, and shifts campaign contributions toward in-district candidates, implying welfare gains from better information and more district-focused political participation. However, these effects are heterogeneous across counties, and redistricting often does not drastically change district homophily, leading to uneven benefits. Moreover, once social learning is considered, turnout decisions become dependent on how boundaries are drawn, raising fairness concerns: districts with highly aligned networks gain more informational and turnout advantages, while others may gain less. The results also imply potential policy trade-offs: using social-network data to draw fairer districts could enhance information diffusion and representation, but could also be exploited by partisan actors seeking to manipulate outcomes.",

Also linked to Swing Voter’s Curse literature. (Source: page 18, words 275–496)\n\n- Campaign contributions data and identification strategy\n  - Data: campaign contributions to House candidates from Kuziemko et al. 2023 (Oct), built from FEC data via Bonica 2014.\n  - Identification: geocode to flag whether contributor lives in the same congressional district as the candidate. (Source: page 18)\n\n- Border-pairs empirical design and estimation\n  - Design: compare county-pair deviations from their pair mean; restrict to counties fully within one district; collapse to county level to keep within-district border variation.\n  - Key specification: y_ct = α_c + μ_pt + β π̄_c,t + X_ct δ + ε_ct (11); β is the coefficient of interest; include state-by-year fixed effects; no district-by-year fixed effects due to data limits. (Source: page 28, 0–349)\n\n- Conceptual framework: information diffusion within districts\n  - Main idea: district homophily summarizes network structure, shaping the diffusion of information and the equilibrium share of informed voters. (Source: page 39, 0–327)\n\n- Appendix B: data construction and variable descriptions\n  - B.1: construction of vote-count measures (county-by-CD; sources include Harvard MIT data for various years, Dave Leip’s Atlas, Daily Kos)\n  - B.2: variable descriptions for CES and voting outcomes (e.g., Heard of Representative, Selected Party, Voted in General Election, etc.)\n  - B.3–B.5: descriptive statistics for CES outcomes and voting measures (Source: page 47–49)\n\n- Appendix C: data and figures (highlights)\n  - C2: results for border-pairs design; C5, C11, C14 figures illustrating district homophily effects on self-reported voting outcomes (Source: page 64; figure references on 54, 61, 64)\n\nIf you’d like, I can extract specific equations or variable definitions into a compact reference list.
