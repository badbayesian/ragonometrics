All Homescan results are weighted for national representativeness. Sources and caveats noted (Nielsen data are the researchers’ data and Nielsen had no role in analysis). (Context: page 1, words 275–483; page 8, words 0–349; page 8, 275–393)\n- How prices are treated\n  - Prices from RMS are deflated to 2010 USD; RMS excludes bulk produce and other nonpackaged items. (Context: page 8, 0–349; page 8, 275–393)\n- Main empirical goal\n  - Decompose differences in healthy eating across income groups into supply-side (prices, availability) and demand-side (preferences) factors. Robustness checks with census-region-by-product fixed effects and urban/rural interactions. (Context: page 41, 275–411; page 27, 275–482)\n- Key result: share of nutrition–income gap explained by demand vs supply\n  - Across specifications, supply explains roughly 7%–12% and demand explains roughly 88%–93% of the nutrition–income relationship; about 90% is due to demand, ~10% to supply. (Context: page 41, 275–411)\n- Methodological approach to endogeneity and location\n  - Use a partial equilibrium thought experiment and geographic variation to bound the role of location. Online Appendix figures map geographic presence of retailers; produce prices are predicted to be cheap on the West Coast and expensive on the East Coast (addressing endogeneity via geographic/instrumental variation). (Context: page 27, 275–482; page 32, 275–431)\n- Illustrative empirical result (Coke vs. Pepsi)\n  - An empirical exercise using county Coke market shares shows a statistically significant τ̂ ≈ 0.16: moving to a county with a 10 percentage point higher Coke share is associated with a 1.6 percentage point increase in Coke’s share within Coke+Pepsi purchases. (Context: page 27, 275–482)\n- Instrumental/identification notes\n  - The study constructs a multi-faceted instrument based on geographic price variation across major retailers (the five largest RMS retailers), with online Appendix figures illustrating these variations and their implication for identification. (Context: page 32, 275–431)\n- Notes on data interpretation and scope\n  - The conclusions reflect the researchers’ analyses of Nielsen data and are not Nielsen’s statements; results are presented with several robustness checks, including alternative specifications and fixed effects. (Context: page 1, 275–483)\n- Example of reported nutrient preferences by income (illustrative table)\n  - Table IV shows estimated nutrient preferences by income quartile across several nutrients and health indices; units and interpretation are provided (e.g., WTP for health index). (Context: page 36, 0–349; page 38, 275–377)\n\nIf you’d like, I can extract a concise formal summary (with equations) or tailor the bullets to a specific subsection (e.g., data, estimation, or robustness results).",

The study’s results come from a 2004–2016 event-study using within-household fixed effects and market-level controls; thus, longer horizons or markets with different retailer mixes or price dynamics could yield larger or smaller expenditure-share effects and different Health Index responses. Heterogeneity by income and food-desert status also matters, with effects typically larger for low-income households in food deserts and most entrant gains reflecting diverted sales rather than new purchases. The identification rests on within-market price variation in a given year, so markets with little within-market variation or different competitive dynamics may produce different estimates, and the validity of the instrument relies on limited cross-market demand shocks being uncorrelated.",

        "answer": "- Data and samples used\n  - Homescan panel data (demographics, calories, health measures) and Nielsen RMS price/sales data (2006–2016; about 35,000 stores observed per year; exclude liquor; channels: grocery, mass merchandiser, drug, convenience). All Homescan results are weighted for national representativeness. Sources and caveats noted (Nielsen data are the researchers’ data and Nielsen had no role in analysis). (Context: page 1, words 275–483; page 8, words 0–349; page 8, 275–393)\n- How prices are treated\n  - Prices from RMS are deflated to 2010 USD; RMS excludes bulk produce and other nonpackaged items. (Context: page 8, 0–349; page 8, 275–393)\n- Main empirical goal\n  - Decompose differences in healthy eating across income groups into supply-side (prices, availability) and demand-side (preferences) factors. Robustness checks with census-region-by-product fixed effects and urban/rural interactions. (Context: page 41, 275–411; page 27, 275–482)\n- Key result: share of nutrition–income gap explained by demand vs supply\n  - Across specifications, supply explains roughly 7%–12% and demand explains roughly 88%–93% of the nutrition–income relationship; about 90% is due to demand, ~10% to supply. (Context: page 41, 275–411)\n- Methodological approach to endogeneity and location\n  - Use a partial equilibrium thought experiment and geographic variation to bound the role of location. Online Appendix figures map geographic presence of retailers; produce prices are predicted to be cheap on the West Coast and expensive on the East Coast (addressing endogeneity via geographic/instrumental variation). (Context: page 27, 275–482; page 32, 275–431)\n- Illustrative empirical result (Coke vs. Pepsi)\n  - An empirical exercise using county Coke market shares shows a statistically significant τ̂ ≈ 0.16: moving to a county with a 10 percentage point higher Coke share is associated with a 1.6 percentage point increase in Coke’s share within Coke+Pepsi purchases. (Context: page 27, 275–482)\n- Instrumental/identification notes\n  - The study constructs a multi-faceted instrument based on geographic price variation across major retailers (the five largest RMS retailers), with online Appendix figures illustrating these variations and their implication for identification. (Context: page 32, 275–431)\n- Notes on data interpretation and scope\n  - The conclusions reflect the researchers’ analyses of Nielsen data and are not Nielsen’s statements; results are presented with several robustness checks, including alternative specifications and fixed effects. (Context: page 1, 275–483)\n- Example of reported nutrient preferences by income (illustrative table)\n  - Table IV shows estimated nutrient preferences by income quartile across several nutrients and health indices; units and interpretation are provided (e.g., WTP for health index). (Context: page 36, 0–349; page 38, 275–377)\n\nIf you’d like, I can extract a concise formal summary (with equations) or tailor the bullets to a specific subsection (e.g., data, estimation, or robustness results).",
