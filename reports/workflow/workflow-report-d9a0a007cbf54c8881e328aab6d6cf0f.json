        "answer": "- Objective and data\n  - Analyzes the impact of NYC’s mandatory calorie posting on chain restaurants using two datasets (store-day transaction data and cardholder data) in NYC vs control cities (Boston/Philadelphia). POST = 1 after April 1, 2008; results rely on NYC vs controls and fixed effects/controls. (page 13, 275-528)\n\n- Overall impact on calories\n  - Calorie posting reduces average calories per store-day by about 4.6 calories, with the reduction in calories per transaction smaller, consistent with an increase in total transactions after posting. (page 13, 275-528)\n\n- Seattle placebo comparison (external validation)\n  - In Seattle, beverage calories per transaction fell by 4.6 calories, while food calories per transaction rose by 0.8 calories, suggesting beverage-focused effects and little noise from the posting policy elsewhere. (page 15, 0-254)\n\n- Item- and per-item effects\n  - Table 4 (transaction data) shows: number of beverages per transaction increases modestly (0.005***); number of food items per transaction falls (−0.029***); calories per beverage and per food item also decline (log beverage calories per beverage: −0.008***; log food calories per food item: −0.039***). (page 18, 0-349)\n  - Interpretation: the reduction in calories is driven both by fewer items purchased (extensive margin with food items) and by lower calories per item (intensive margin). Food items contribute notably to the effect. (page 18, 0-349)\n\n- Main channel: extensive margin dominates\n  - About three quarters of the total calorie reduction is attributed to people opting not to buy food items (extensive margin of food demand). (page 18, 0-349)\n\n- Distributional and heterogeneity patterns\n  - Quantile evidence: calorie reductions are larger for higher quantiles; the percent change is roughly stable around 5–6 percent from 75th to 99th percentile, though absolute decreases are larger at higher quantiles. (page 22, 0-349)\n  - Heterogeneity: effects differ by characteristics (e.g., income, education, age, gender, customer type); e.g., higher-income and more-educated groups show additional differential effects (Posting × median income, Posting × percent with college degree, etc.). (page 21, 0-349)\n\n- Summary takeaway\n  - Mandatory calorie posting reduces calories per transaction primarily through reduced food purchases (extensive margin) and, to a lesser extent, lower calories per item; effects are larger for higher-calorie consumers and more pronounced at higher consumption quantiles. (page 18, 0-349; page 21-22, 0-349)\n\nSources used:\n- NYC calorie posting effects and overall magnitude: page 13, words 275-528\n- Seattle placebo example: page 15, words 0-254\n- Table 4 item-level and margin findings: page 18, words 0-349\n- Extensive-margin interpretation: page 18, words 0-349\n- Distributional/heterogeneity results: pages 21-22, words 0-349",

(page 13, 275-528)\n  - Decomposes effects into extensive vs. intensive margins, showing calories drop primarily through reduced food purchases (extensive margin) and, to a lesser extent, lower calories per item. (page 18, 0-349)\n  - Provides distributional and heterogeneity analyses, showing larger reductions for higher-calorie consumers and higher quantiles; differential effects by income, education, etc. (pages 21-22, 0-349)\n  - Includes external validation via a Seattle placebo, suggesting beverage-focused effects and limited noise from the policy elsewhere. (page 15, 0-254)\n\n- Identification strategy\n  - Difference-in-differences design comparing NYC to control cities with a POST indicator (1 after April 1, 2008), using fixed effects and additional controls; evidence drawn from store-day transaction data and cardholder data. (page 13, 275-528)\n\n- Key results\n  - Overall effect: calories per store-day fall by about 4.6; calories per transaction fall less, consistent with more total transactions after posting. (page 13, 275-528)\n  - Item- and per-item effects (Table 4): beverages per transaction up modestly (0.005***); food items per transaction down (−0.029***); calories per beverage and per food item both decline (log beverage calories per beverage: −0.008***; log calories per food item: −0.039***). (page 18, 0-349)\n  - Mechanism: the calorie reduction is driven by both extensive margin (fewer food items purchased) and intensive margin (lower calories per item), with food items contributing notably. (page 18, 0-349)\n  - Main channel: extensive margin dominates—about three-quarters of the total calorie reduction comes from not purchasing food items. (page 18, 0-349)\n  - Distributional and heterogeneity patterns: larger reductions at higher quantiles; percent change roughly 5–6% from 75th to 99th percentile; effects differ by income, education, age, gender, and customer type (Posting × interactions). (pages 21-22, 0-349)\n  - Summary takeaway: mandatory posting reduces calories per transaction mainly via reduced food purchases (extensive margin) and, to a lesser extent, lower calories per item; effects stronger for higher-calorie consumers and at higher consumption quantiles. (page 18, 0-349; pages 21-22, 0-349)\n\n- Limitations\n  - Limitations are not explicitly enumerated in the provided excerpts; robustness checks include a Seattle placebo, which supports external validity to some extent but does not fully generalize beyond the studied contexts.

Total calories per transaction declined around 5–6% (about 5.8% in transaction data and 5.0% in cardholder data), translating to roughly 14.4 fewer calories per transaction. Beverage calories were largely unchanged. The impact was larger for high-calorie purchasers (e.g., a 26% reduction for those who tended to make high-calorie purchases). There was some evidence of a price-per-item increase, and profits were not significantly affected. In a back-of-the-envelope macro calculation, the authors suggest that even a 6% reduction in calories at all chain restaurants could have meaningful population-level implications.",

(2010) and related work (Anderson & Matsa 2011) connecting fast-food exposure and labeling to obesity outcomes, which frames what calorie-posting studies aim to influence; 4) DellaVigna (2009) and Chetty, Looney, and Kroft (2009) offering a theoretical framework on learning versus salience to interpret posting effects; 5) Variyam & Cawley (2006) and Jin & Leslie (2003, 2009) addressing signaling and the signaling value of labels in restaurant and grocery contexts. Collectively, these works establish that information provision at the point of purchase can affect choices, that the magnitude and interpretation depend on learning versus salience, and that obesity outcomes are an important but complex downstream question.",

        "answer": "- Objective and data\n  - Analyzes the impact of NYC’s mandatory calorie posting on chain restaurants using two datasets (store-day transaction data and cardholder data) in NYC vs control cities (Boston/Philadelphia). POST = 1 after April 1, 2008; results rely on NYC vs controls and fixed effects/controls. (page 13, 275-528)\n\n- Overall impact on calories\n  - Calorie posting reduces average calories per store-day by about 4.6 calories, with the reduction in calories per transaction smaller, consistent with an increase in total transactions after posting. (page 13, 275-528)\n\n- Seattle placebo comparison (external validation)\n  - In Seattle, beverage calories per transaction fell by 4.6 calories, while food calories per transaction rose by 0.8 calories, suggesting beverage-focused effects and little noise from the posting policy elsewhere. (page 15, 0-254)\n\n- Item- and per-item effects\n  - Table 4 (transaction data) shows: number of beverages per transaction increases modestly (0.005***); number of food items per transaction falls (−0.029***); calories per beverage and per food item also decline (log beverage calories per beverage: −0.008***; log food calories per food item: −0.039***). (page 18, 0-349)\n  - Interpretation: the reduction in calories is driven both by fewer items purchased (extensive margin with food items) and by lower calories per item (intensive margin). Food items contribute notably to the effect. (page 18, 0-349)\n\n- Main channel: extensive margin dominates\n  - About three quarters of the total calorie reduction is attributed to people opting not to buy food items (extensive margin of food demand). (page 18, 0-349)\n\n- Distributional and heterogeneity patterns\n  - Quantile evidence: calorie reductions are larger for higher quantiles; the percent change is roughly stable around 5–6 percent from 75th to 99th percentile, though absolute decreases are larger at higher quantiles. (page 22, 0-349)\n  - Heterogeneity: effects differ by characteristics (e.g., income, education, age, gender, customer type); e.g., higher-income and more-educated groups show additional differential effects (Posting × median income, Posting × percent with college degree, etc.). (page 21, 0-349)\n\n- Summary takeaway\n  - Mandatory calorie posting reduces calories per transaction primarily through reduced food purchases (extensive margin) and, to a lesser extent, lower calories per item; effects are larger for higher-calorie consumers and more pronounced at higher consumption quantiles. (page 18, 0-349; page 21-22, 0-349)\n\nSources used:\n- NYC calorie posting effects and overall magnitude: page 13, words 275-528\n- Seattle placebo example: page 15, words 0-254\n- Table 4 item-level and margin findings: page 18, words 0-349\n- Extensive-margin interpretation: page 18, words 0-349\n- Distributional/heterogeneity results: pages 21-22, words 0-349",
