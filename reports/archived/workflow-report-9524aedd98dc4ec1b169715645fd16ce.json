To avoid false positives across many tests, they adjust for multiple testing (Hochberg/Benjamini-Hochberg) and determine p* by simulating null hashing with an incorrect hash position so that zero assignments would occur. P-values are computed across time windows (7, 31, 91 days) and across roughly half a trillion tests, leading to very small p* values. They validate the p* thresholds by comparing hash positions (e.g., position-10 vs position-11) and show that the thresholds are designed to minimize erroneous assignments, implying that genuinely overrepresented IPs can be identified with high confidence while maintaining conservatism against false positives.",

Robustness checks using three time windows (7, 31, and 91 days) and three hash starting positions (9, 10, and 11) reveal that correctly calibrated windows and hash positions matter: with the incorrect position (hash position-11) none of the posts are assigned to an IP address, whereas with the correct hash (position-9/10) a large share of posts have p-values below the threshold. The thresholds are extremely small (to control a huge number of tests), and larger windows raise the risk of “stealing” posts by highly active IPs, though bogon addresses produce zero assignments. Overall, results are robust across the tested bandwidths when hashing is correct, but are sensitive to the hash choice and especially to window size that can inflate certain errors if not properly accounted for.",

        "answer": "Across different time periods and markets, the study’s results could change in several ways. First, temporal dynamics matter: posting frequency and forum composition evolved from 2010–2014 and then shifted notably during the COVID-19 period, which was associated with a large rise in activity; such changes affect the power to detect IP overrepresentation and the observed p-value distributions. Second, the hash-position methodology and noise modeling can alter results if hashing details shift or differ by period or market (for example, an infamous 2013 shift in username hashing changed which position is used). Third, geographic and market structure matter: the geographic distribution by country and time-of-day patterns vary (time-of-day distributions by country), and IP retention or university-IP patterns differ across markets, influencing geolocation accuracy and the persistence of IP addresses. Fourth, the analysis depends on time-window choices (7-, 31-, 91-day windows) and the thresholds tied to those windows; markets with irregular posting rhythms could yield different minimum p-values and detection power. Finally, content characteristics such as the share of toxic posts can vary over time and across markets, potentially altering observed relationships. In short, stronger signals are more likely in periods with high activity and stable posting patterns, while shifts in hashing, geolocation, and market structure can modulate both the magnitude and significance of the inferred effects.",

Toxicity is uneven: a small subset of IP addresses accounts for much of the toxic content, and posts from university IPs are, on average, less toxic than those from non-university IPs, though there is substantial heterogeneity across universities. Additionally, the ability to de-anonymize IPs from usernames raises privacy concerns that could deter participation. Overall, the platform can improve information access for some groups while simultaneously exacerbating discrimination and unequal participation for others, shaping distributional welfare in the economics field.",
