Also notes that the goal was incremental improvement, not perfection. (page 22, words 215-415)\n\n- Post-deobfuscation modeling: run posts through transformer-based models for sentiment, misogyny, and toxicity; sentiment model = DistilBERT fine-tuned for SST on Stanford Sentiment Treebank; misogyny model = BERT fine-tuned (Attanasio et al., 2022); toxicity model = ToxiGen Roberta fine-tuned for toxicity; re-create Wu (2020) word-count measures. (page 23, words 0-274)\n\n- Geolocation of IP addresses: use IP2Location for country, city, lat/long, ZIP, ISP, domain; discuss IP retention (average US IP held ~19 days; most users have at least one long-lived IP); university IP geolocation tends to be more accurate. (Mishra et al., 2020; Saxon & Feamster, 2022). (page 22, words 215-415)\n\n- Time stamps: EJMR does not display exact post times; time visibility depends on post age. (page 23, words 0-274)\n\n- Toxicity findings (via toxicity model): share of toxic posts measured by ToxiGen Roberta; about 10% of posts are toxic over time with mild seasonal fluctuations (higher in summer); toxic posts concentrate more across IP addresses than overall posts.

They apply corrections for multiple hypothesis testing (Hochberg/Tamhane, Benjamini–Hochberg) and calibrate p* by comparing results under a null hashing position (a hash-shift method that renders most IPs as noise). The thresholds are computed for 7-, 31-, and 91-day windows (e.g., p* = 1.37e-10, 2.51e-11, 1.39e-11, respectively) and validated across three hash positions (9, 10, 11). Figure 3 is used to show how minimum p-values evolve over time, supporting the reliability of the assignments.

For example, COVID-19 increased monthly postings (altering baseline noise and detection dynamics), while the hashing position shift changed which hash positions are treated as signal versus noise. Markets with different IP-block structures or university/IP retention may yield different IP overrepresentation signals and p-value thresholds, and country- or time-of-day differences (as shown in country distributions and time-of-day figures) suggest that the observed effects are not uniform across markets or time windows. The p-value thresholds themselves depend on the time window (7-, 31-, and 91-day), so periods with higher or lower activity will influence how easily an IP’s observed explanatory power stands out from noise.",
