Below is a concise synthesis of key definitions, data, and identification from the provided context, with citations.\n\n- Roll-off (House turnout relative to top-of-ticket)\n  - Definition: Share of top-of-ticket voters who abstain from the House race: (VotesTop − VotesHouse) / VotesTop; captures abstention after incurring the cost of voting; related to “roll-off” literature (Feddersen & Pesendorfer 1996; Miller 2022; Snyder & Strömberg 2010) (page 18 words 275-496).\n  - Variable construction and scope: Main analysis at county level from Dave Leip’s; robustness at county-by-CD level from Harvard EDA, Daily Kos, Dave Leip’s, and MIT EDS Lab; exclude elections without a top-of-ticket race (page 49 words 0-276).\n  - Summary stats: Mean 4.42%, SD 12.22 pp; also report turnout in top-of-ticket (mean 51.34%) and House (mean 49.07%) (page 49 words 0-276).\n\n- Campaign contributions data\n  - Source: Kuziemko et al. 2023 (October), constructed from FEC data in Bonica 2014; geocoding used to identify whether contributor resides in the same congressional district as the candidate (page 18 words 275-496).\n\n- Border pairs identification design\n  - Setup: Neighboring county pairs that straddle a district boundary; counties are similar except district assignment, yielding different district homophily; restrict to counties fully within one district; collapse outcomes to county level; include one observation per county–pair; compare within-state pairs; precision decreases due to restricted sample (page 28 words 0-349).\n  - Specification:\n    - $y_{ct} = \\alpha_c + \\mu_{pt} + \\beta\\,\\bar{\\pi}_{c,t} + X'_{ct}\\delta + \\varepsilon_{ct}$, where $y_{ct}$ is the outcome, $\\mu_{pt}$ pair-by-year FE, $X_{ct}$ time-varying county controls; use state-by-year FE (insufficient data for district-by-year FE) (page 28 words 0-349).\n  - Results note: Qualitatively similar to redistricting design; estimates on “Selected Party” become insignificant after adding DMA-by-year FE (page 28 words 0-349).\n\n- Conceptual framework\n  - Develops a theoretical model of information diffusion within districts; district homophily summarized as a network statistic; considers news about elected officials diffusing through networks to determine the equilibrium share of informed voters (page 28 words 0-349).\n\n- Vote count data construction\n  - County-by-CD measures built from precinct-level vote counts (Harvard EDA 2000–2010; MIT EDS Lab 2016–2020) combined with county-by-CD vote counts from Dave Leip’s (House) and Daily Kos (President, Senator, Governor) (page 47 words 0-207).\n\n- CES variables and summary statistics (knowledge, preferences, voting)\n  - Knowledge outcomes (binary): Heard of Representative; Selected Party; Selected Correct Party; defined via pre-survey items on recognizing and assigning party to the House representative (page 47 words 0-207).\n  - Voting/preference outcomes (binary): Prefer Incumbent/Opponent/Neither (pre-survey); Voted for Incumbent/Opponent/Neither (post-survey); Validated turnout in general/primary; self-reported general turnout; handling of missing when no incumbent or unmatched rolls (page 48 words 0-333).\n  - Summary (sample means): Heard of Rep 93.2%; Selected Party 68.6%; Selected Correct Party 61.7%; Prefer Incumbent 40.1%; Voted for Incumbent 41.0%; Validated General Turnout 57.5%; Self-Reported General Turnout 87.8% (page 49 words 0-276).\n\n- Additional pointers\n  - Figures showing effects of homophily on self-reported voting using commuting- and zip-code-based measures (Figures C11, C14); a figure on changes in district homophily with progressively finer bins (Figure C5) (page 61 words 0-15; page 64 words 0-45; page 54 words 0-18).",

    "final_answer": "- Core contribution: Formalizes and empirically tests how district homophily governs the diffusion of information about elected officials—modeled as a network statistic that determines the equilibrium share of informed voters—and links this mechanism to electoral behavior. Empirically, it identifies homophily’s effects using a within-state border-pairs design and operationalizes participation via a precise roll-off measure. (page 28 words 0-349; page 18 words 275-496)\n\n- Theory to measurement: Develops a model of news diffusion within districts, summarizing district homophily as a network statistic shaping the informed share; operationalizes abstention conditional on showing up via roll-off $=(\\text{VotesTop}-\\text{VotesHouse})/\\text{VotesTop}$. (page 28 words 0-349; page 18 words 275-496)\n\n- Identification: Implements a neighboring-county border-pairs design with county and pair-by-year fixed effects and time-varying controls to isolate district-assignment-induced differences in homophily; documents robustness and the sensitivity of “Selected Party” to adding DMA-by-year FE. (page 28 words 0-349)\n\n- Data infrastructure: Assembles multi-source county and county-by-CD vote counts (precinct-level EDA/EDS merged with Dave Leip’s and Daily Kos), CES-based knowledge/preference/turnout measures, and geocoded FEC contributions identifying in-district contributors—enabling comprehensive tests of the theory. (page 47 words 0-207; page 48 words 0-333; page 18 words 275-496)\n\n- Empirical grounding: Provides descriptive baselines for roll-off and turnout (mean roll-off 4.42%; top-of-ticket turnout 51.34%; House turnout 49.07%) and for voter knowledge/behavior (e.g., Heard of Rep 93.2%; Validated General Turnout 57.5%), anchoring the analysis.

Results largely survive: the effects on ‘Heard of Incumbent’ and ‘Selected Correct Party’ remain positive and statistically significant across specifications with these controls, while the weaker ‘Selected Party’ measure loses significance. Placebo outcomes show no significant relationship, supporting robustness.",

Placebo tests for governors/senators show no effects, and using commuting flows as an alternative network measure yields qualitatively similar effects at about half the magnitude.

(1944); evidence on diffusion in networks (Conley & Udry 2010; Banerjee et al. 2013; Beaman et al. 2021); and explicit calls for causal work (Fowler et al. 2011)—motivating the paper’s causal designs and its focus on district homophily; (3) Empirical and experimental studies of peer influence and information transmission—lab/field evidence (Klar & Shmargad 2017; Druckman et al. 2018; Fafchamps et al. 2019; Arias et al. 2019) and turnout contagion/peer effects (Gerber et al. 2008; Sinclair et al. 2012; Klofstad 2007; Nickerson 2008; Pons 2018), plus place effects (Cantoni & Pons 2022; Brown et al. 2023)—which ground the mechanisms linking networks to knowledge and participation. Methodologically, the paper’s border-pairs identification follows Spenkuch & Toniatti (2018). It also leverages national social-tie data in the spirit of Alt et al. (2022) and demonstrates large-scale social influence akin to Bond et al. (2012). Conceptually, its diffusion model aligns with network diffusion under homophily (Jackson & López-Pintado 2013) and segregation measures (Echenique & Fryer 2007). Finally, the knowledge–turnout link (Snyder & Strömberg 2010) underpins why increased information from higher district homophily can shift participation.",

Below is a concise synthesis of key definitions, data, and identification from the provided context, with citations.\n\n- Roll-off (House turnout relative to top-of-ticket)\n  - Definition: Share of top-of-ticket voters who abstain from the House race: (VotesTop − VotesHouse) / VotesTop; captures abstention after incurring the cost of voting; related to “roll-off” literature (Feddersen & Pesendorfer 1996; Miller 2022; Snyder & Strömberg 2010) (page 18 words 275-496).\n  - Variable construction and scope: Main analysis at county level from Dave Leip’s; robustness at county-by-CD level from Harvard EDA, Daily Kos, Dave Leip’s, and MIT EDS Lab; exclude elections without a top-of-ticket race (page 49 words 0-276).\n  - Summary stats: Mean 4.42%, SD 12.22 pp; also report turnout in top-of-ticket (mean 51.34%) and House (mean 49.07%) (page 49 words 0-276).\n\n- Campaign contributions data\n  - Source: Kuziemko et al. 2023 (October), constructed from FEC data in Bonica 2014; geocoding used to identify whether contributor resides in the same congressional district as the candidate (page 18 words 275-496).\n\n- Border pairs identification design\n  - Setup: Neighboring county pairs that straddle a district boundary; counties are similar except district assignment, yielding different district homophily; restrict to counties fully within one district; collapse outcomes to county level; include one observation per county–pair; compare within-state pairs; precision decreases due to restricted sample (page 28 words 0-349).\n  - Specification:\n    - $y_{ct} = \\alpha_c + \\mu_{pt} + \\beta\\,\\bar{\\pi}_{c,t} + X'_{ct}\\delta + \\varepsilon_{ct}$, where $y_{ct}$ is the outcome, $\\mu_{pt}$ pair-by-year FE, $X_{ct}$ time-varying county controls; use state-by-year FE (insufficient data for district-by-year FE) (page 28 words 0-349).\n  - Results note: Qualitatively similar to redistricting design; estimates on “Selected Party” become insignificant after adding DMA-by-year FE (page 28 words 0-349).\n\n- Conceptual framework\n  - Develops a theoretical model of information diffusion within districts; district homophily summarized as a network statistic; considers news about elected officials diffusing through networks to determine the equilibrium share of informed voters (page 28 words 0-349).\n\n- Vote count data construction\n  - County-by-CD measures built from precinct-level vote counts (Harvard EDA 2000–2010; MIT EDS Lab 2016–2020) combined with county-by-CD vote counts from Dave Leip’s (House) and Daily Kos (President, Senator, Governor) (page 47 words 0-207).\n\n- CES variables and summary statistics (knowledge, preferences, voting)\n  - Knowledge outcomes (binary): Heard of Representative; Selected Party; Selected Correct Party; defined via pre-survey items on recognizing and assigning party to the House representative (page 47 words 0-207).\n  - Voting/preference outcomes (binary): Prefer Incumbent/Opponent/Neither (pre-survey); Voted for Incumbent/Opponent/Neither (post-survey); Validated turnout in general/primary; self-reported general turnout; handling of missing when no incumbent or unmatched rolls (page 48 words 0-333).\n  - Summary (sample means): Heard of Rep 93.2%; Selected Party 68.6%; Selected Correct Party 61.7%; Prefer Incumbent 40.1%; Voted for Incumbent 41.0%; Validated General Turnout 57.5%; Self-Reported General Turnout 87.8% (page 49 words 0-276).\n\n- Additional pointers\n  - Figures showing effects of homophily on self-reported voting using commuting- and zip-code-based measures (Figures C11, C14); a figure on changes in district homophily with progressively finer bins (Figure C5) (page 61 words 0-15; page 64 words 0-45; page 54 words 0-18).",
