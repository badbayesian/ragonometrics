        "answer": "- EJMR posts are largely anonymous, with four-character usernames; authors show that the posting scheme enables linking posts to IP addresses with high probability. They recovered 47,630 distinct IPs and matched them to 66.1% of ~7 million posts over 12 years. (Source: page 1, words 0-242)\n\n- The study geolocates posts and analyzes aggregated cross-sectional variation in toxic speech across sub-forums, geographies, institutions, and contributors. (Source: page 1, words 0-242)\n\n- IP-based assignments have a small error rate: about 0.2% of assignments can be incorrect; most IP matching occurs within a 7-day window. (Source: page 22, words 0-349)\n\n- Linguistic analysis: posts are heavily obfuscated, requiring deobfuscation (removing symbols, decoding leetspeak, mapping obfuscated terms to canonical forms) before ML classification. (Source: page 22, words 0-349)\n\n- Deobfuscation pipeline includes language identification (English, German, Chinese, Korean, etc.), a dictionary of high-frequency obfuscated terms, symbol removal, and leetspeak normalization. (Source: page 22-23, words 0-349)\n\n- Post-deobfuscation, the authors apply transformer-based models for sentiment (DistilBERT fine-tuned on SST-2), misogyny, and toxicity (ToxiGen RoBERTa), plus replication of Wu (2020) word-count measures. (Source: page 23, words 0-349)\n\n- IP geolocation uses IP2Location to obtain country, city, latitude/longitude, ZIP, ISP, and domain; university IPs tend to be more retention-stable, and geolocation is particularly accurate for universities. (Source: page 22, words 0-349)\n\n- Time-stamps and post identifiers: EJMR does not show exact times for all posts, but provides an RSS feed with exact timestamps for the most recent 10 posts and each post has a unique auto-incrementing post ID. (Source: page 23, words 0-349)\n\n- Figures illustrating findings: \n  - Figure 19 shows the share of toxic posts over time (toxic speech measure via ToxiGen RoBERTa). (Source: page 39, words 0-30)\n  - Figure 23 shows linguistic patterns of contributing IPs, using SBERT embeddings and clustering; proximity indicates linguistic similarity. (Source: page 45, words 0-117)\n\n- Additional methodological notes: the study includes a linguistics-based clustering of IP-contributors and highlights substantial clusters of linguistically similar users. (Source: page 45, words 0-117)\n\n- References to data and tools: uses SBERT for vector representations, UMAP for projection, and HDBSCAN for clustering; IP2Location for geolocation; ToxiGen RoBERTa, DistilBERT SST-2, and misogyny models. (Source: page 23, words 0-349; page 39; page 45)\n\nIf you’d like, I can extract a focused summary for a specific research question (e.g., toxicity trends by geography) with the exact cited lines.",

(Sources: page 22-23, words 0-349)\n\n- Geolocation and IP reliability: Uses IP2Location to extract country, city, latitude/longitude, ZIP, ISP, and domain; university IPs show retention stability and higher geolocation accuracy; IP-based assignments have ~0.2% error, with most matches within a 7-day window. (Sources: page 22, words 0-349)\n\n- Data integration and analysis design: Combines time-stamped posts (RSS feed with exact timestamps for recent posts; each post has a unique auto-incrementing ID) with cross-sectional analysis of toxic speech across geography, institutions, and contributors. (Sources: page 23, words 0-349)\n\n- Linguistic and network insights: Employs SBERT for vector representations, along with UMAP and HDBSCAN for clustering; finds substantial clusters of linguistically similar IP-contributors, and presents figures illustrating temporal toxic trends and linguistic patterns among contributing IPs.

Under the null πa = 0, the observed likelihood simplifies to a form that depends only on q(kt). The framework uses a Poisson-binomial approach to test whether πa > 0 and to estimate πa, and it addresses multiple testing concerns. To improve identification, the authors propose windowing the data in time intervals, and assigning posts to the smallest set of IP addresses that can explain them within a window across multiple topics.

Additionally, only IPs with sufficiently unusual (i.e., unlikely by chance) activity are considered for attribution, using a very small p-value threshold (p*) and assigning each post to the IP with the lowest p-value only if that p-value is below p*.

In total, we compute almost 9 quadrillion hashes to fully enumerate all possible IP combinations and to check which of the resulting substrings of hashes match the observed usernames. For each post, this roughly narrows the set of possible IP addresses from 232 to 216 . Second, we measure which IP addresses occur particularly often in a narrow time window and use the uniformity property of the SHA-1 hash to test whether these IP addresses appear more often than would likely occur by chance. Our statistical test is very conservative and minimizes the probability of falsely assigning an IP address to a post because the p-value thresholds we employ are of the order of approximately 10−11 .",
