        "answer": "Could you clarify what you’d like from these excerpts (e.g., statistic definitions, testing procedure, simulation setup/results, or computational complexity)? Key points available here include:\n\n- ICSS statistic and F-test link\n  - For a fixed k, the usual two-sample variance F statistic is\n    $F_{T-k,k} = \\frac{(C_T - C_k)/(T-k)}{C_k/k}$, where $C_k=\\sum_{t=1}^k a_t^2$; $D_k$ is a monotone function of $F_{T-k,k}$ and depends on k only via $k/T$. Unlike the F-test (known k), ICSS searches $\\max_k |D_k|$ to locate a change point [page 3 words 0–349].\n  - Asymptotically (Normal noise), the $D_k$ process is a Brownian bridge; an example uses the 5% critical value 1.358 with detection at $k^*=342$ when $\\max_k|D_k|$ exceeds this boundary [page 3 words 0–349].\n\n- Asymptotics and moments under homogeneity\n  - Under $N_T=0$: $E[C_k]=k\\sigma^2$, $E[C_k C_T]=k(T+2)\\sigma^4$, and $E[D_k]\\to 0$ as $T$ grows [page 11 words 275–507].\n  - Appendix sketch: with $t_i=a_i^2-\\sigma^2$, a Donsker-type argument yields convergence to a Brownian bridge $W^0$ [page 12 words 0–349].\n\n- Likelihood ratio (LR) testing for number of change points\n  - Strategy: sequentially test $H_0:N_T=n-1$ vs $H_a:N_T=n$ using $LR_{n-1,n}$ for $n=1,2,\\dots$; critical values require simulation because the problem is nonregular [page 8 words 0–329].\n  - Standardize $LR_{n-1,n}$ to reference the extreme value limit with cdf $F(x)=\\exp(-e^{-x})$; formulas for standardization are given in Table 3 (referenced) [page 8 words 0–329].\n\n- Bayesian posterior odds (multiple change points)\n  - Posterior odds compare $p(N_T=n\\mid a)$ across n, using $p(a,K\\mid N_T)$ and a per-time prior change probability $X$; details and Table 5 summarize two-change cases [page 8 words 0–329].\n\n- Simulation design (comparisons: ICSS, LR, Bayesian)\n  - 1,000 replicates per design; $T\\in\\{100,200,500\\}$; one-change locations $K/T\\in\\{.25,.5,.75\\}$; variance ratios $A\\in\\{2,3\\}$. Two-change locations $(K_1/T,K_2/T)\\in\\{(.33,.66),(.20,.80),(.58,.80)\\}$ with permutations of $(\\sigma_1^2,\\sigma_2^2,\\sigma_3^2)$ constrained by $A_1=\\sigma_2^2/\\sigma_1^2$, $A_2=\\sigma_3^2/\\sigma_2^2$ and symmetry reductions. Data are iid $N(0,1)$; Fortran implementation; RNG via Bratley–Fox–Schrage; Sparcstation 1+ [page 7 words 0–349; page 7 words 275–556].\n\n- Main empirical findings (one change)\n  - With $T=100$ and small variance ratio ($A=2$), detection is hard—especially if the change is near the beginning—with ICSS. With $T=200$ or $A=3$, correct identification exceeds 80% when the change is near the middle. ICSS improves with larger T and A. The Bayesian approach performs best for $A=2$ and is comparable to others for $A=3$ [page 9 words 550–899].\n\n- AR(1) residual application\n  - Generate $Y_t=\\phi Y_{t-1}+a_t$; apply ICSS to residuals $\\varepsilon_t=Y_t-\\hat\\phi Y_{t-1}$. The percentage with $N_T=1$ is close to the iid results in Table 4 (see Table 8) [page 9 words 550–899; page 10 words 0–84].\n\n- Computational burden\n  - ICSS was designed to avoid the heavy computation of posterior odds and the need to evaluate functions at all possible change locations. LR uses Baufays–Rasson’s algorithm for maximizing the likelihood but remains heavy for long series and multiple changes [page 9 words 825–904].\n  - CPU-time scaling: LR is roughly $O(T^3)$ and of similar order for $N_T=2$ and $N_T=3$; ICSS’s dependence on T is the same across values of $N_T$ (lower and more stable cost) [page 11 words 275–507].",

    "final_answer": "- Primary: Introduces the ICSS procedure for variance change-point detection—built on a statistic $D_k$ that is a monotone transform of the two-sample variance F statistic $F_{T-k,k}=\\frac{(C_T-C_k)/(T-k)}{C_k/k}$ with $C_k=\\sum_{t=1}^k a_t^2$—and locates breaks by maximizing $\\max_k |D_k|$; under homogeneity, the $D_k$ process converges to a Brownian bridge, enabling use of fixed critical values (e.g., 5% ≈ 1.358) for inference [page 3 words 0–349; page 12 words 0–349].\n\n- Supporting:\n  - Provides asymptotic moments under no breaks (e.g., $E[C_k]=k\\sigma^2$, $E[C_k C_T]=k(T+2)\\sigma^4$) and shows $E[D_k]\\to 0$ as $T$ grows, justifying the null behavior used for thresholding [page 11 words 275–507].\n  - Benchmarks ICSS against likelihood-ratio and Bayesian posterior-odds approaches via extensive simulations (various $T$, change locations, and variance ratios), showing strong detection except when changes are very early and small; performance improves with larger $T$ and variance ratios [page 7 words 0–349; page 7 words 275–556; page 9 words 550–899].\n  - Establishes ICSS as a computationally light alternative with stable, lower CPU cost versus LR (roughly $O(T^3)$), especially beneficial for long series and multiple changes [page 9 words 825–904; page 11 words 275–507].\n  - Extends application to AR(1) settings via prewhitened residuals, yielding results close to the i.i.d. case [page 9 words 550–899; page 10 words 0–84].\n  - Outlines complementary testing frameworks: sequential LR tests for the number of change points with extreme-value (Gumbel) standardization, and Bayesian posterior odds with per-time change probability, to compare modeling strategies [page 8 words 0–329].",

Implications: max|Dk| is biased toward mid-series but its mode occurs at the true changepoint and concentrates there as T or the variance ratio increases; small changes (A=2) in short series (T=100), especially early in the series, are hard to detect with ICSS, while for T≥200 or A=3, correct identification exceeds ~80% when the change is near the middle; the Bayesian approach performs best for A=2, and ICSS improves with larger T and A.

Bayesian is best for A=2 and comparable for A=3.\n- Two change points: with T≥200, ICSS generally outperforms likelihood ratio tests; best when change points are evenly spaced (.33T, .67T) and when the largest variance is in the middle (A1,A2)=(4,2). Monotone-increasing variances require larger T (e.g., 500) to identify both changes >50% of the time.\n- Posterior-odds approach is computationally prohibitive (e.g., ~1,358 CPU hours for T=500), limiting practicality.\n- Location statistic k*: distribution is skewed and biased toward the middle, but the mode aligns with the true change; concentration around the true point improves with larger T and variance ratios.\n- Applying ICSS to AR(1) residuals yields similar identification rates to the i.i.d. case.",

Detection performance depends on sample size, spacing and configuration of variance changes, variance ratios, and data idiosyncrasies. Longer samples improve identification and localization; equal spacing between change points tends to perform best; monotone variance increases are hardest (often requiring many more observations). Performance improves as variance ratios increase. Multiple change points can mask each other, but the iterative ICSS procedure mitigates this. Outliers can create false peaks and should be checked. Applying ICSS to autoregressive residuals yields results similar to independent data. Hence, different time periods or markets—if they differ in length, volatility regime patterns, outlier prevalence, or autocorrelation—can produce different numbers and locations of detected variance changes and different accuracy levels.",

(2) Control ICSS iterations to avoid cycling (cap iterations; declare convergence when change-point locations move by <2 observations). (3) After detecting change points, estimate segment variances to build a homogeneous “corrected series” and compute residual diagnostics (e.g., Q statistic) on that corrected series. (4) For likelihood-ratio testing, proceed sequentially with LR_{n-1,n}, obtain critical values by simulation, and standardize to an extreme value distribution. (5) For Bayesian inference, compute posterior-odds K_{n,n-1} up to a specified maximum number of changes Nmax and choose NT maximizing the conditional probability. (6) For time series with dynamics, apply ICSS to residuals from fitted AR models. (7) Practical power guidance: small samples (T≈100) and small variance ratios (A=2), especially with early changes, are hard to detect; performance improves notably with longer series (T≥200) or larger variance ratios (A=3).",

        "answer": "Results are sensitive to the chosen test/estimator, critical values, and data-generation specifications. Method choice: For small variance changes (A=2), the Bayesian posterior-odds approach performs best, while ICSS improves notably with larger samples or larger variance ratios and often outperforms likelihood-ratio (LR) tests; LR is frequently weaker in multi-change settings. Threshold choice: Using empirical quantiles for max|Dk| yields lower critical values than the asymptotic 1.358, reducing type I error relative to the asymptotic boundary, so conclusions depend on whether asymptotic or simulation-based cutoffs are used. Model structure and iteration: Accounting for adjacent changepoints can remove previously ‘significant’ candidates (e.g., point 342 becomes non-significant after neighboring points are included), indicating sensitivity to the iterative specification. Estimation context: Applying ICSS to AR(1) residuals using OLS produces detection rates very close to the i.i.d. case, suggesting limited sensitivity to estimating the AR parameter. Estimator of location k*: its sampling distribution is skewed (biased toward the center), but the mode is at the true change; concentration improves with larger T or larger variance ratios. Performance also depends on changepoint locations and variance configurations (hardest under monotone increases; easier with equal segment lengths or when the large variance is in the middle).",
