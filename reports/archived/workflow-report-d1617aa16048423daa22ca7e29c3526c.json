        "answer": "- Data sources and coverage\n  - Homescan records packaged groceries; in 2004–2006, an 8,000-household “magnet” subsample also recorded nonpackaged items. About 60% of magnet households’ produce calories are from packaged goods, with no statistical income differences, suggesting packaged focus is reasonably representative for produce and that produce is a small share of groceries overall (page 8, words 0–349).\n  - Households report income (16 bins), composition, demographics; researchers compute daily calorie needs using Dietary Guidelines and scale children to adult equivalents. PanelViews add-on (2017) provides health importance, nutrition quiz, BMI, diabetes; results are nationally weighted (page 8, words 0–349).\n  - RMS: weekly UPC-level prices/volumes at ~42,000 stores from 160 chains (≈35,000/year observed) for 2006–2016; excludes liquor and bulk produce. Channel coverage: 53% grocery, 32% mass merchandiser, 55% drug, 2% convenience. Prices/incomes deflated to 2010 dollars using CPI-U (page 8, words 275–393).\n\n- Identification and market structure facts\n  - Substantial geographic variation in the presence of the five largest retailers; these chains set different relative prices across product groups, yielding geographic price instruments. Example: produce predicted cheap on West Coast and expensive on East Coast, likely due to California production; market fixed effects address endogeneity from demand elasticity differences across markets (page 32, words 275–431).\n  - Within-household regressions: adding demographic controls changes results little and increases R^2 only slightly, implying possible unobserved within-household changes (Oster 2019). A migration-style thought experiment considers moving a household from low- to high-income retail environments (partial equilibrium) (page 27, words 275–482).\n  - Validation: replicates immediate brand choice migration effect for Coke vs. Pepsi with τ̂ ≈ 0.16; a 10 pp higher county Coke share raises a household’s Coke share by 1.6 pp (page 27, words 275–482).\n\n- Preference estimates (Table IV) and WTP for health\n  - GMM estimates of nutrient preference parameters by income quartile show:\n    - Higher-income quartiles have more negative WTP for sodium and added sugar, and more positive WTP for whole fruit and whole grains; patterns are monotonic across quartiles (page 36, words 0–349).\n    - “WTP for Health Index” rises with income: Q1 ≈ 0.429, Q2 ≈ 0.631, Q3 ≈ 0.820, Q4 ≈ 1.141 (SEs shown in table) (page 36, words 0–349).\n  - Units: sodium (g), whole/other fruit and dairy (cups), whole/refined grains and proteins (oz), added sugar (tsp), solid fats (calories). WTP for Health Index defined as $\\sum_c \\hat{\\beta}_c s_c r_c$ (page 36, words 0–349).\n\n- Decomposition: supply vs. demand in nutrition–income gaps\n  - Across alternative specifications (including census-region-by–product group fixed effects and interactions with urban/rural and above-median income), supply explains 7%–12% and demand explains 88%–93% of the nutrition–income relationship; summary: about 90% demand, 10% supply (page 41, words 275–411; page 38, words 275–377).\n  - The unobserved characteristic $\\hat{\\xi}$ is attributed to demand because it primarily determines demand elasticity with respect to price (page 41, words 275–411).\n\n- Demographic controls used in outcomes regressions\n  - Controls include household size, age indicators, log years of education, race, marital status, employment, weekly work hours, plus add-on variables such as the self-reported importance of staying healthy (page 42, words 275–356; page 8, words 0–349).",

        "answer": "The pivotal prior work is Bitler and Haider (2011), which argues that much existing research assumes supply-side (retail access) causes food deserts and concludes there is insufficient evidence that food deserts systematically cause unhealthy diets. This frames the central question the paper tackles by testing place effects and supply-side explanations. In addition, a core set of earlier food-access studies (Alwitt & Donley 1997; Horowitz et al. 2004; Jetter & Cassady 2005; Algert, Agrawal & Lewis 2006; Baker et al. 2006; Powell et al. 2007; Larson, Story & Nelson 2009; Sharkey, Horel & Dean 2010) are central as they embody the supply-side perspective that this paper evaluates and ultimately finds limited for explaining nutritional inequality.",

(2) RMS is a sample, not a census; the store-type mix in RMS may not match a county’s true distribution, requiring regression adjustment with ZBP and leaving scope for residual area-level measurement error in the Health Index. (3) Household residence is observed only at year-end, so exposure around moves is measured annually; within-year moves and local shopping patterns can cause misclassification, mitigated via a 50% local-shopping restriction. (4) Self-reported health-related variables (e.g., BMI, diabetes, health importance, nutrition knowledge) are likely subject to reporting/recall error.

Equalizing supply (e.g., eliminating food deserts) reduces nutritional inequality by at most about 10%, implying limited welfare gains from costly store subsidies. In contrast, a means-tested subsidy tied to product healthfulness and targeted to bottom-quartile households can achieve the same or greater improvements at transparent costs: about $84 million to match the effect of one nearby supermarket entry, $830 million to match full supply equalization, and $11 billion (≈15% of the SNAP budget) to close the entire gap. The authors caution that healthy eating is not the sole social objective and government outlays are not a complete measure of social costs, so a full welfare framework is needed, but distributionally, targeted subsidies are more cost-effective at improving low-income households’ healthy grocery consumption than supply-side interventions.",

        "answer": "- Data sources and coverage\n  - Homescan records packaged groceries; in 2004–2006, an 8,000-household “magnet” subsample also recorded nonpackaged items. About 60% of magnet households’ produce calories are from packaged goods, with no statistical income differences, suggesting packaged focus is reasonably representative for produce and that produce is a small share of groceries overall (page 8, words 0–349).\n  - Households report income (16 bins), composition, demographics; researchers compute daily calorie needs using Dietary Guidelines and scale children to adult equivalents. PanelViews add-on (2017) provides health importance, nutrition quiz, BMI, diabetes; results are nationally weighted (page 8, words 0–349).\n  - RMS: weekly UPC-level prices/volumes at ~42,000 stores from 160 chains (≈35,000/year observed) for 2006–2016; excludes liquor and bulk produce. Channel coverage: 53% grocery, 32% mass merchandiser, 55% drug, 2% convenience. Prices/incomes deflated to 2010 dollars using CPI-U (page 8, words 275–393).\n\n- Identification and market structure facts\n  - Substantial geographic variation in the presence of the five largest retailers; these chains set different relative prices across product groups, yielding geographic price instruments. Example: produce predicted cheap on West Coast and expensive on East Coast, likely due to California production; market fixed effects address endogeneity from demand elasticity differences across markets (page 32, words 275–431).\n  - Within-household regressions: adding demographic controls changes results little and increases R^2 only slightly, implying possible unobserved within-household changes (Oster 2019). A migration-style thought experiment considers moving a household from low- to high-income retail environments (partial equilibrium) (page 27, words 275–482).\n  - Validation: replicates immediate brand choice migration effect for Coke vs. Pepsi with τ̂ ≈ 0.16; a 10 pp higher county Coke share raises a household’s Coke share by 1.6 pp (page 27, words 275–482).\n\n- Preference estimates (Table IV) and WTP for health\n  - GMM estimates of nutrient preference parameters by income quartile show:\n    - Higher-income quartiles have more negative WTP for sodium and added sugar, and more positive WTP for whole fruit and whole grains; patterns are monotonic across quartiles (page 36, words 0–349).\n    - “WTP for Health Index” rises with income: Q1 ≈ 0.429, Q2 ≈ 0.631, Q3 ≈ 0.820, Q4 ≈ 1.141 (SEs shown in table) (page 36, words 0–349).\n  - Units: sodium (g), whole/other fruit and dairy (cups), whole/refined grains and proteins (oz), added sugar (tsp), solid fats (calories). WTP for Health Index defined as $\\sum_c \\hat{\\beta}_c s_c r_c$ (page 36, words 0–349).\n\n- Decomposition: supply vs. demand in nutrition–income gaps\n  - Across alternative specifications (including census-region-by–product group fixed effects and interactions with urban/rural and above-median income), supply explains 7%–12% and demand explains 88%–93% of the nutrition–income relationship; summary: about 90% demand, 10% supply (page 41, words 275–411; page 38, words 275–377).\n  - The unobserved characteristic $\\hat{\\xi}$ is attributed to demand because it primarily determines demand elasticity with respect to price (page 41, words 275–411).\n\n- Demographic controls used in outcomes regressions\n  - Controls include household size, age indicators, log years of education, race, marital status, employment, weekly work hours, plus add-on variables such as the self-reported importance of staying healthy (page 42, words 275–356; page 8, words 0–349).",
